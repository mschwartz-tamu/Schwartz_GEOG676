|The program that will be used to compile and manipulate the data will be [ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/get-started.htm) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started). With extensions such as python, coding project parameters into ArcGIS pro can be made easy in Visual Studio Code.|Data for this project was collected from the EPA, your local government website, and the Department of Health and Saftey. Data sets in the form of Excel documents can be converted into GIS data sets using the provided code.|The code implemented below will ensure that all data sets collected will produce maps within the same coordinate system, ensuring that all information is displayed in a uniform map scale.|Once all necessary data points have been collected and converted to the proper map scale, we will create a master database that will store all data sorces and maps for this project.|
